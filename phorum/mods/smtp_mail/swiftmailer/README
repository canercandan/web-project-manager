Swift Mailer is an advanced Mailing Library for PHP.

At each release two versions are packaged up.  One is for PHP5 and the other for PHP4.
Make sure you have downloaded the correct version.

For installation instructions take a look at the INSTALL file.  If you have used version 2
of Swift Mailer in the past you should note that these instructions have since been changed.

    An enormous amount of time and effort has been devoted to the development of this release
    for public use.  Swift is released free of charge but if you feel that this library is worth
    it and has helped you in any way you may wish to consider giving a donation by PayPal:
    
    PayPal to: chris@w3style.co.uk
    
    Donations help to contribute towards my hosting costs and anything on-top is just a bonus
    which makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside ;)  Currently I'll put donations towards
    spending money I'll use in Australia when I go travelling in September 2007.

For those who are familiar with version 2 you should take a look at the CHANGES file since
version 3 is a complete re-write of version 2 and implements a completely new API.  For the
most part EasySwift provides a wrapper which gives the API of version 2.

Because I moderate at http://forums.devnetwork.net/ I am lucky enough to have a forum just for
Swift Mailer.  If you have any queries then feel free to either drop me and email or ask on the
forum: http://forums.devnetwork.net/viewforum.php?f=52

I hope you like this fresh new release of Swift Mailer!
