      Why do I always end up at the top of a page when using the back button?
    </title>
    <para>
      Your PHP setup is probably sending headers along with the reply, telling
      the browser to not cache the page. Therefore, when going to the previous
      page, it will be reloaded as if it were a new page. You can tweak the
      PHP settings to not have PHP sending these headers. Edit the php.ini and
      set the "session.cache_limiter" directive to have no value at all. So
      the line in php.ini would end up like this:
      <programlisting>
        session.cache_limiter =
      </programlisting>
      After editing the php.ini, restart the webserver. From then on, using
      the back button should work like expected.

      If you do not have access to php.ini (you are using a hosting account),
      submit a request to your host asking that they change the
      aforementioned parameter for you. Most hosts should be willing to do
      this in the majority of cases.

  		Create a new user using the registration form, and then set
  		the admin parameter of the user to 1 in the database itself.
  		This can be done using phpmyAdmin or a similar control panel,
  		or the shell.
